Test features of the Model Coupling Toolkit within a
pseudo coupled model system.

Uses the Single Executable -- No Overlap version of MPH.

Default is for 16 processors total

To build, first build the mpeu and mct libraries
then type "./configure" and "make all".


runscripts are provided for various platforms.
You may need to edit to change directory paths,
project numbers, etc.

NOTE: utmct now reads in sparsematrix elements.  The
file containing this is assumed to be in ../data.

THINGS TO TRY:

>Change the number of processors the unit tester uses.

For the ocean (pop.F) and coupler (cpl.F), you only need to edit the
entries in processors_in.map.  No need to recompile.  The MCT will
recalculate the Router based on the new coupler GlobalSegMap.
MPH will assign the specified processors to the model.

For the atmosphere (ccm.F), edit the Makefile and look for
the definition of _D  (line 28 or so).  Change NPROCS_LATA and
NPROCS_LONA to the combination you want to try.  (Each must
be a power of two.) Then do a "make clean" and "make all".
Also be sure to edit processors.map to accommodate the larger
number of processors.

>Change the number of points in the Atmosphere grid.

Edit Nax and Nay in the _D definition in the Makefile.
recompile.  Each must be a power-of-two if you're going to
use the same decomposition strategy.

>Change the decomposition strategy.

Comment out or delete the relevant code in cpl.F or atm.F and
describe your own decomposition strategy.  Initialize the
GlobalSegMap appropriately.
