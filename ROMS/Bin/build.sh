# workstation, a local cluster and a remote supercomputer) you can checkout 
# the latest release and always get an up-to-date customized source on each

# definition.  Both single or double quotes works. For example, to write
# time-averaged fields set:
#
#    setenv MY_CPP_FLAGS "-DAVERAGES"

# details on other options the user might want to set here. Be sure to
