# README for roms-trunk-mgh

This is a Git repository of the Rutgers ROMS trunk source code with changes made by Mark Hadfield
at NIWA. The master copy is held on the NIWA Gitlab server in project hadfield/roms-trunk-mgh.

An unmodified copy of the Rutgers ROMS trunk source code is also being maintained on the NIWA Gitlab server
in project hadfield/roms-trunk.

The intention for the current repository is to pull changes from Rutgers regularly, via hadfield/roms-trunk,
while maintaining the local changes under version control.

A further project, hadfield/roms-trunk-mgh-aquaculture, will be created to hold the much more extensive modifications
made to ROMS at NIWA by Mark Hadfield and Niall Broekhuizen, relating to fish farms and mussel farms.
