# README for roms-trunk-mgh

This is a Git repository of the Rutgers ROMS trunk source code with changes made by Mark Hadfield
at NIWA. The master copy is held on the NIWA Gitlab server in project hadfield/roms-trunk-mgh.

An unmodified copy of the Rutgers ROMS trunk source code is also being maintained on the NIWA Gitlab server
in project hadfield/roms-trunk.

The intention for the current repository is to regularly fetch changes from the Rutgers trunk, via hadfield/roms-trunk,
and incorporate them with the locally-modified code.

A further project, hadfield/roms-trunk-mgh-aquaculture, has be created to hold the much more extensive modifications
made to ROMS at NIWA by Mark Hadfield and Niall Broekhuizen, relating to fish farms and mussel farms. This will fetch 
and incorporate changes from hadfield/roms-trunk-mgh.
