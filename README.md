# README for roms-trunk-mgh

This is a Git repository of the Rutgers ROMS source code with changes made by Mark Hadfield
at NIWA. The repository is hosted on GitHub.com at https://github.com/hadfieldnz/roms-trunk-mgh

The roms-trunk branch contains unmodified ROMS source code
imported from the Rutgers Subversion repository, https://www.myroms.org/svn/src/trunk.

The master branch contains the same source code with local modifications (mostly minor).

The intention for the current repository is to regularly fetch changes from Rutgers, import them into
roms-trunk, and then merge them into master.

This version of the README file is on the narrows branch, which implements tracer sources used to
investigate tracer transport in Cook Strait for a paper to be submitted to a special issue of
New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research.
