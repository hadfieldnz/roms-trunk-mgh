# README for roms-trunk-mgh

This is a Git repository of the Rutgers ROMS source code with changes made by Mark Hadfield
at NIWA. The repository is hosted on GitHub.com at https://github.com/hadfieldnz/roms-trunk-mgh 

The roms-trunk branch contains unmodified ROMS source code
imported from the Rutgers Subversion repository, https://www.myroms.org/svn/src/trunk.

The master branch contains the same source code with local modifications (mostly minor) including this
README file.

The intention for the current repository is to regularly fetch changes from Rutgers, import them into
roms-trunk, and then merge them into master.
