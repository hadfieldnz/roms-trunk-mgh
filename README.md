# README for roms-trunk

This is a Git repository of the Rutgers ROMS source code. The original is held on a Subversion server at Rutgers University:

    https://www.myroms.org/svn/src/trunk/

The present repository has been cloned at NIWA with git svn. It differs from
the original only by the addition of this README file. The intention is to
keep the repository it up to date with the Rutgers original.

Clones of this repository will be used to store NIWA-local changes to ROMS.
